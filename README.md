ACL Module 2.0
==============

This is a module that implements an Access Control Mechanism based on Distributed Computing Environment.

Version 2.0 has the same public interface as version 1.x except the package name space is changed from com.tee.uit.security to eionet.acl.
Installation and usage:
-----------------------
This package is built with Maven, and is deployed to the agency repository.
```
$ mvn deploy
```

Add this to your pom.xml:
```
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>eea</id>
        <name>EEA Release Repository</name>
        <url>http://archiva.eionet.europa.eu/repository/internal</url>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
        </snapshots>
    </repository>
</repositories>

```


Configuration:
--------------
- Create the ACL database tables - edit your project's Liquibase change log file and add the change sets from the dbChangeLog.xml.

- Copy `*.acl, acl.group, acl.prms` and `users.xml` from `src/test/resources` to external folder and make the necessary editing.

- Copy `uit.properties` from `src/test/resources` to your project's classpath and change the property values accordingly.
  Note that the file and folder paths in the `uit.properties` are relative because of unit tests. For other usage, absolute paths should be used.


Unit tests:
-----------
All the sources for unit tests are in src/test/java and src/test/resources.

As configured in AccessControlListTest.java and uit.properties, the database tests are run on H2 in-memory database. The database structure
is located in dbChangeLog.xml which is the change log file for Liquibase. Because MySql and H2 databases differ a little, there are modifications
to SQL so it would work on both of the databases.
